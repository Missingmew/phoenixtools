even:
	begins with 0x80000001
	followed by palette 0x20 bytes (4bpp)
	followed by table
	followed by tile data

odd:
	begins with table
	first entry:
	uint16_t null
	uint16_t numthings
	uint32_t null
	
	following entries:
	uint16_t offset (from beginning of table)
	uint16_t size (in bytes)
	uint32_t null
	
	data at offset like this:
	uint32_t numitems (4bytes per item)
	uint32_t items[] (numitems times)
	items are possibly OAM data
