PAC File format specification

Known filename extensions: .pac

The file format is used by Capcom.

The file is read in little endian mode.

The file begins with a 4 byte long integer specifying the number of files in it.

Following that is just that many 8 byte long records for each file in the archive.
The first 4 bytes in each record is the file offset in the archive while the next 4 is the size of the file.

There are no filenames provided by the format.
